Increases the movement animation speed to closer to what it was for The Long War, so you don't have to spend so much time watching units run from place to place.  It is entirely cosmetic.

Most of the edits for this mod came from https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/446ym8/speeding_up_animations_and_gameplay/
If anyone knows of any other similar improvements that cna be made, please post in the discussion for this mod and I'll try to incorporate them.

There are still some slowdowns no one is sure how to edit out.  In particular, the weird 3 second pause after some actions.
