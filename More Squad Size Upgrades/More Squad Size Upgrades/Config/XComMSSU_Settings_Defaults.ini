; How to handle the squad select screen, since it only allows 6 soldiers by default.  Valid options:
; "Fit all soldiers": Shrink squad UI to fit everyone on the screen
; "Scrollbar": Use a scrollbar to select 7th/8th soldier
; "Compatibility mode": Use another mod to manage squad select screen
+SquadSelectUI="Fit all soldiers"

; Using a larger starting squad than 4 requires separate mods, which is why the option is not exposed in the options menu
; See the mod description on Steam for more details
+StartingSquadSize=4
